This repository contains the R codes and data sets used to illustrate the paper

"Inference on Dynamic Systemic Risk Measures."

The names of the R files are explicit: 

- in directory "Simulations", "forTable2.R" is used to obtain Table 2 with the caption "Coverage rates and interval widths for the 95\% CI of the CoVaR(10\%, 20\%) estimated by the three methods - Data are generated by GARCH models with Student Innovations"

- in directory "Simulations", "forTable3.R" is used to obtain Table 3 with the caption "Backtesting
results on simulated data  with bivariate Student distribution of $\nu=6$ degrees of freedom $\rho$=0.6, and $\alpha_0=5\%$"

- in directory "SP500", "forTable4.R" is used to obtain Table 4 with the caption "Backtesting results  for $H_0$ (Frequency of Null Rejection over a selection of 426 US Stocks) at the nominal level $\alpha_0=5\%$ with the S\&P 500 as the conditioning asset"

- in directory "SP500", "forFigure1.R" is used to obtain Figure 1 with the caption "Bootstrapped 90\%-CI of AAPL's CoVaR(10\%, 20\%), conditional on the S\&P 500 being at risk"

- in directory "SP500", "forFigure2.R" is used to obtain Figure 2 with the caption "-CoVaR(10\%, 20\%) of AAPL conditional on S\&P 500 daily log-returns (top graph) and -VaR(20\%) of S\&P 500 (bottom graph).
\textcolor{red}{Red}: exceedances of CoVaR (process 1) and VaR (process 2); \textcolor{green}{green}: exceedances of VaR while no exceedances of CoVaR; \textcolor{orange}{orange}: exceedances of CoVaR while no exceedances of VaR.} The number of violations of the VaR (44+7 = 51  red + green bullets) and CoVaR (7 red bullets) are close to the nominal numbers
$T \alpha'  = 50$ and $T \alpha \alpha'= 250 \times 0.1 \times 0.2 = 5$, respectively."


- in directory "Yujian", "forTable5.R" is used to obtain Table5 with the caption " Ranking of Financial Institutions by Systemic Impact (i.e. $\overline{\Delta CoVaR}$)"


- in directory "Julien/Banks", "forFigure3.R" is used to obtain Figure 3 with the caption "Average $\Delta$CoVaR for the financial system versus average VaR of the conditioning series (major financial institutions) over the considered period"

- in directory "Julien/Banks", "forFigure4.R" is used to obtain Figure 4 with the caption "Evolution of the ratio $\Delta$CoVaR of the system / VaR of the institution over time (3,000 observations) | risk levels: $\alpha=5\%$, $\alpha'=10\%$, $\alpha''=20\%$ - rolling period of 21 days"

- in directory "Julien/CDS", "forFigure5.R" is used to obtain Figure 5 with the caption "CDS spreads of selected Eurozone countries between 2013 and 2021"

- in directory "Julien/CDS", "forFigure6.R" is used to obtain Figure 6 with the caption"-$\hat{u}(0.5, 0.5)$ as a measure of tail dependence of Portugal 5-year sovereign CDS spreads conditional on the CDS spread log-returns of 10 Eurozone countries (+UK)"
